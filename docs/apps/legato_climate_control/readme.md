# Legato Climate Control

![](./../../images/legato_climate_control.png)

This demonstration emulates an interactive, touch-enabled vehicle climate control User Interface (UI).

It runs on the PIC32MZ DA Curiosity board with a 24-bit passthrough graphics interface card and a 5” WVGA display. Because all frame buffers are stored in SRAM, the ideal target for the demo application is the PIC32MZ DAK/DAL with no DDR.

This demonstration runs on:
